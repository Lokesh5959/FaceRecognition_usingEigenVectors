# FaceRecognition_usingEigenVectors

Used Eigen Vectors concept, by applying SVD (singular value decomposition) and created new data points by decreassed dimentions.
Euclidean distances are calculated and used to detect test cases
Simple and Basic face recognition technique using Eigen vectors and euclidean distance concept

NOTE : Basic implementation using desired image dimentions and test image dimentions,
may get low accuracy while used to more noisy data.
